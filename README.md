#This is a command line program which uses basic database calls. 

#The program allows you to select from ten different items and "purhase" one. 

#After selecting the item you wish to purchase, you can then enter the quantity you would like to purchase. If the quantity is too high, it will tell you. If there is enough in inventory it will tell you the purchase price.
